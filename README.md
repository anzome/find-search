Find the Search
==========

Google Chrome extension that allows you to put coursor in the search field with shortcut. By default you it uses ctrl+i. Maybe later I'll add option page for it where everyone will be able to set his own shortcut.

Here it is https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/find-the-search/ihcfpglfbokhgbfcliokjagkabgkehgp

For installation you should download **package/find_search.crx** file and then drag it and drop on page **chrome://chrome/extensions/** in your both Google Chrome or Yandex.Browser.
