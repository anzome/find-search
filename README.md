Find the Search
==========

Google Chrome extension that allows you to put coursor in the search field with shortcut. By default you it uses ctrl+i. Maybe later I'll add option page for it where everyone will be able to set his own shortcut.

Here it is https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/find-the-search/ihcfpglfbokhgbfcliokjagkabgkehgp

v 0.3.1
- repair google analytics counter

v 0.3
- I improved rules for seeking search fields on a page.
- If plugin can't find fiels that fits at least to one rules but there are some visible input fields it put cursor in one of them.
