Find the Search
==========

Google Chrome extension that allows you to put coursor in the search field with shortcut. By default you it uses ctrl+i. Maybe later I'll add option page for it where everyone will be able to set his own shortcut.

Here it is https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/find-the-search/ihcfpglfbokhgbfcliokjagkabgkehgp
