Find the Search
===============

Google Chrome extension that allows you to put coursor in the search field with shortcut. By default you it uses ctrl+i. Maybe later I'll add option page for it where everyone will be able to set his own shortcut.

Here it is https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/find-the-search/ihcfpglfbokhgbfcliokjagkabgkehgp

For installation you should download **package/find_search.crx** file and then drag it and drop on page **chrome://chrome/extensions/** in your both Google Chrome or Yandex.Browser.


Changelog
=========
v0.3
- big changes for future. I hope it will be usefull when I decide to add new triks to find search inputs.
- add new check for parents. Is one of them navbar or not. If yes, we make assumption that we get one of the search inputs.
